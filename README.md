# PythonProjects
OCR and automation projects

The projects introduced in this repository are production versions of the codes which are still in place for the processes of one of the customers that I wokred for (IT industry). 
I changed or removed parts of the code which would contain confidential information. 
In some cases I needed to change the programs to correspond with example files downloaded from open sources, as no customer files are used in this repository. 

The OCR_invoice code retrieves information from an example file located in the link below:
